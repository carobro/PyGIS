## Research Question

### To what extent does the behaviour of owls in urban environments differ from that in rural areas?   
â€¢ How do nocturnal activities differ in both categories?   
â€¢ To what extent does the hunting radius differ?   
â€¢ How do hunting times differ in both categories?   

### Things that have caught our attention:
`tag_ident` is like an id to identify the single owls (indipendently from the time/track series)
